# porosity_frkn

IFM plug-in to modify porosity, conductivity and storage based on a reaction declared in the FEFLOW reaction kinetics editor, it works on 2D and 3D models.

lines         /  content
1 - 112       /  lines generated by FEFLOW when plug-in is created.
28-44         /  plug-in callbacks: Serialize (stored data at the end of FEM file), OnEditDocument (input window), PostTimeStep (calculations)
117-148       /  variable declaration. it is no the optimal way to do it this way but it works.
150-201       /  serialize: all variables from the plug-in window in FEFLOW GUI are stored at the end of FEM file and recovered when the FEM is open.
203-362       /  plug-in input window
371-571       /  dissolution rate and porosity calculations
412-420       /  the plug-in does not makes calculations on all simulation time-steps (too slow). this IF allows to decide if porosity is updated based on the time-step "g3_deltat_double"
431-481       / FOR loop to visit all elements in FEM and make a mass transport species average from nodes. reaction rate is estimated and porosity upgraded.
488-588       / based on new porosity, K, Ss and molecular diffusion (?) are calculated
508 - 516     / molecular diffusion (?) these lines are specific for karst growth and tidal pumping (thesis chapter 5). comment this lines for other problems. 

# porosity_pichem

IFM plug-in to modify porosity, conductivity and specific storage. The plug-in uses as input solute transport data generated by plug-in pichem.

# FEFLOW command line and Linux

Some bash files to control FEFLOW in command line

08_parallel.sh - a bash loop that launches x number of FEFLOW runs, with y number of simultaneous FEFLOW runs.
09_single_core.sh - a bash loop to run x number of FEFLOW command line runs, one FEFLOW run at a time.
