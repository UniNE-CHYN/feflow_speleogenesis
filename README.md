# porosity_frkn

IFM plug-in to modify porosity, conductivity and storage based on a reaction declared in the FEFLOW reaction kinetics editor, it works on 2D and 3D models.

lines         /  content

1 - 112       /  lines generated by FEFLOW when plug-in is created.

28-44         /  plug-in callbacks: Serialize (stored data at the end of FEM file), OnEditDocument (input window), PostTimeStep (calculations)

117-148       /  variable declaration. it is no the optimal way to do it this way but it works.

150-201       /  serialize: all variables from the plug-in window in FEFLOW GUI are stored at the end of FEM file and recovered when the FEM is open.

203-362       /  plug-in input window

371-571       /  dissolution rate and porosity calculations

412-420       /  the plug-in does not makes calculations on all simulation time-steps (too slow). this IF allows to decide if porosity is updated based on the time-step "g3_deltat_double"

431-481       / FOR loop to visit all elements in FEM and make a mass transport species average from nodes. reaction rate is estimated and porosity upgraded.

488-588       / based on new porosity, K, Ss and molecular diffusion (?) are calculated

508 - 516     / molecular diffusion (?) these lines are specific for karst growth and tidal pumping (thesis chapter 5). comment this lines for other problems. 

# porosity_pichem

IFM plug-in to modify porosity, conductivity and specific storage. The plug-in uses as input solute transport data generated by plug-in pichem. pichem : https://www.mikepoweredbydhi.com/download/mike-2017/pichem-plugin?ref=%7B48049242-9F00-48BE-82FA-7D0C1820F7A8%7D

Export to TXT selected nodal data from transient simulations at selected times by the user.

# FEFLOW command line 

Some bash files to control FEFLOW in command line. The commands are explained here http://www.feflow.info/html/help/default.htm?turl=HTMLDocuments%2Fpackage%2Fcommand_line_mode.htm

08_parallel.sh - a bash loop that launches x number of FEFLOW runs, with y number of simultaneous FEFLOW runs.

09_single_core.sh - a bash loop to run x number of FEFLOW command line runs, one FEFLOW run at a time.

# Linux compilation of plug-ins

In Windows it's done with Visual Studio 2013. On linux with gcc and a makefile.
